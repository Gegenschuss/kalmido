# Team: workload, absences, disposition

Kalmido's team views live in **Workload** (sidebar, module "Workload"). Since 2.50.0 the view has three tabs:
**Workload**, **Absences** and - with the module "Disposition" switched on - **Disposition**.

## Absences (2.50.0)

- Everybody enters their own absences: **Absences > Enter an absence** - vacation, sick leave, day off or other,
  one day or a period, optionally half a day (morning / afternoon) and a note. There is no approval: entering is enough.
- The admins of an organisation can also enter absences for its members.
- **Who sees what:** the team sees *that* somebody is away and when. The kind (above all sick leave) and the note
  only the person and the organisation's admins see. Kind and note are stored encrypted when the server's
  encryption at rest is on.
- **Public holidays:** an organisation's admins pick a German state at the bottom of the tab; Kalmido computes the
  statutory holidays itself (no external service). People without an organisation set their own.
- **Effect:** in the workload a week's capacity shrinks by the absent workdays and holidays (a week away = no
  capacity). *Plan my day* shows a hint instead of a proposal on a day away. Assigning a task to somebody who is
  away on its day shows a warning - the assignment still happens.
- Deleting an absence can be undone.
- Agents read only "away" and the period of their own organisation (`GET /api/v1/absences`, MCP `get_absences`),
  never the kind.

## Disposition (2.50.0)

Book crew and equipment for shoot days and see who and what is free.

- Switch it on in **Settings > Modules > Disposition** (off by default; for organisations and for freelancers in their
  own area).
- **Book:** a title, the day(s), optional times, *Option* (pencilled in) or *Firm*, optionally a project list, and the
  resources: members of the organisation, contacts from the organisation's address books (crew without an account),
  devices and device sets from *Office & finance* (a set books its devices along).
- **Warnings, never blocks:** a person or device booked twice at the same time, or a person who is away
  (vacation, sick leave, day off), is marked; the booking stays.
- **Week grid** with one row per resource (phones: a list per day), **Who is free on ...?** for a single day.
- **My bookings** lists your own bookings; a firm booking also shows up in your News (event "assigned to me", with
  its usual switch in the notification settings).
- Changing or deleting a booking applies to the whole job (one shoot day); deleting can be undone.

## Agents plan with you (2.51.0)

- **Weekly status on the project page**: plan a job for an agent with the template *Status on the pin board*. The agent writes
  one block "Status" on the project page (done, stuck, overdue, who waits on whom) and overwrites only that block each week. It
  is marked "From <agent>, updated ..."; you can edit or delete it as usual. The agent needs the permission *Pin board*.
- **Time tracking**: with the template *Check time tracking and propose entries* the agent points out implausible entries and
  sends one proposal with entries for past events without time. You change times and note and apply it (one undo step). Share
  your calendar with the agent so that it sees your events.
- **Shoot planning**: an agent proposes shoot days and crew / equipment for a project. Warnings show double bookings, absences
  and other projects that day. Applying creates per day a task in the project with a draft in your calendar and pencils in
  crew and equipment as options, never firm.
- **Drafts in the calendar** (tentative events) look pale and dashed and say *Draft*. Tap one: *Confirm* makes it a normal
  event, *Discard* deletes it (undo brings it back).


## Urgent tasks (2.53.0)

The bell in the header of a task decides how that one task notifies you: **As the list** (default), **Muted** (no pushes
for it, News stay) or **Urgent** - until it is completed or until a date. Urgent sends every change and every comment of the
task as a push at the highest priority, even if the list is quiet.

- **For others**: the owner and the admins of a list can mark a task urgent for some or all people of the list (*Urgent for
  others…* in the bell's menu). The people get a News item and see "Urgent, set by ..." on the task. Everyone can switch it
  off for themselves; the task history notes it.
- **Refuse it**: *Settings > Notifications > Accept urgent markings from others* off - such a marking then counts as
  "As the list" for you.
- **Honest limit**: on Android (ntfy) an urgent push comes through. On an iPhone the web app cannot break through Focus or
  silent mode; there it is a prominent push, not an alarm.
